# Experiments
•Develop and execute the following programs using 8086 Assembly Language. Any suitable assembler like MASM/TASM/8086 kit or any equivalent software may be used.

•Program should have suitable comments.

•The board layout and the circuit diagram of the interface are to be provided to the student during the examination.

•Software Required: Open source ARM Development platform, KEIL IDE and Proteus for simulation


# SOFTWARE PROGRAMS: PART A

1.  Design and develop an assembly language program to search a key element “X” in a list of ‘n’ 16-bit numbers. Adopt Binary search algorithm in your program for searching.
2.  Design and develop an assembly program to sort a given set of ‘n’ 16-bit numbers in ascending order. Adopt Bubble Sort algorithm to sort given elements.
3.  Develop an assembly language program to reverse a given string and verify whether it is a palindrome or not. Display the appropriate message.
4.  Develop an assembly language program to compute nCr using recursive procedure. Assume that ‘n’ and ‘r’ are non-negative integers.
5.  Design and develop an assembly language program to read the current time and Date from the system and display it in the standard format on the screen.
6.  To write and simulate ARM assembly language programs for data transfer, arithmetic and logical operations (Demonstrate with the help of a suitable program).
7.  To write and simulate C Programs for ARM microprocessor using KEIL (Demonstrate with the help of a suitable program)
Note : To use KEIL one may refer the book: Insider’s Guide to the ARM7 based microcontrollers, Hitex Ltd.,1st edition, 2005

# HARDWARE PROGRAMS: PART B
8. a.  Design and develop an assembly program to demonstrate BCD Up-Down Counter (00-99) on the Logic Controller Interface.
   b.  Design and develop an assembly program to read the status of two 8-bit inputs (X & Y) from the Logic Controller Interface and display X*Y.
9.  Design and develop an assembly program to display messages “FIRE” and “HELP” alternately with flickering effects on a 7-segment display interface for a suitable period of time. Ensure a flashing rate that makes it easy to read both the messages (Examiner does not specify these delay values nor is it necessary for the student to compute these values).
10.  Design and develop an assembly program to drive a Stepper Motor interface and rotate the motor in specified direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) by N steps (Direction and N are specified by the examiner). Introduce suitable delay between successive steps. (Any arbitrary value for the delay may be assumed by the student).
11.  Design and develop an assembly language program to 
   a.	Generate the Sine Wave using DAC interface (The output of the DAC is to be displayed on the CRO).
   b.	Generate a Half Rectified Sine waveform using the DAC interface. (The output of the       DAC is to be displayed on the CRO)
12.  To interface LCD with ARM processor-- ARM7TDMI/LPC2148. Write and execute programs in C language for displaying text messages and numbers on LCD
13.  To interface Stepper motor with ARM processor-- ARM7TDMI/LPC2148. Write a program to rotate stepper motor

# Study Experiments:
1.	Interfacing of temperature sensor with ARM freedom board (or any other ARM microprocessor board) and display temperature on LCD
2.	To design ARM cortex based automatic number plate recognition system
3.	To design ARM based power saving system
